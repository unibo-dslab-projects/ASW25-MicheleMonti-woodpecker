With the help of \nzugzwang, White is probably able to win the g-pawn. But it doesn’t matter – it’s a fortress anyway. \nIf Black’s king stays on g7, White can never sacrifice the queen to get a winning pawn ending. The \nsame ending is reached after: 38...♖xe5 39.♕e7! (39.♕d8? is a double threat against d4 and g5, but \n39...♖e3† 40.♔g2 ♗f6= defends) 39...♖e3† 40.♔g2 ♗f6 41.♕xa7 ♖e4 42.fxe6 ♖xe6\nSo 38.f5 is only a draw, but it’s a good try that was rewarded in this blitz game: 38...exf5 39.e6\n1–0 The exercise is about decision-making. Calculating all the variations above is not necessary \nbefore playing the first move."
